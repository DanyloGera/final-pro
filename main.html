          <h5 class="card-title">Music</h5>
          <p class="card-text">For me, music opened up a lot and in different ways. From the age of four I learned to play the piano, attended solfeggio and music literature lessons. There were times when I wanted to stop doing this, but with the help of my parents, I have now officially graduated from music school. Although I do not plan to link my career with music, but my life is already connected with music. I continue to play the piano, to learn new works for myself and my family. Now I started playing the guitar,yeah, I really like it!</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Sport</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I have done horting (mixed martial arts) since I was 4 years old. Horting combines boxing, kickboxing and some modern and ancient sports. There we have three categories: wrestling, duel and show fight. I have successfully attended many competitions both in Ukraine and abroad. Now I am also actively involved in football and basketball. Sometimes I do workout elements for extra workload to keep fit. So I do an active lifestyle. Go in for sports! It is good for you, your body, health and beauty!</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Additionally</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Except music and sports, I like to take photos, organize people, love science and programming. I like to help others with anything. I try to be a good friend, student, son, brother, athlete, musician. All this for me and for others! I really want to help people. Whatever profession I choose, businessman, doctor, policeman, programmer, everything will be not only for me. It's hard for people alone so let's change that! Now I am looking for what I can offer the world. ( A little more ). I hope I'm close!!!</p>
